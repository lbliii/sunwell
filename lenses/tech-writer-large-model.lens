  # ==========================================================================
  # HEURISTICS — Large Model Corrections
  # ==========================================================================
  #
  # Large models are GOOD at: structure, clarity, completeness
  # Large models are BAD at: brevity, code-first, directness, parallel thinking
  #
  # Strategy: Don't teach what they know. Fix what they don't.
