  heuristics:
    - name: "Audience First"
      rule: "Write for your reader, not for yourself"
      priority: 0.95
      wisdom:
        - "The reader's context determines everything"
        - "What seems obvious to you isn't obvious to them"
        - "Their goals matter more than your expertise"
      judgment:
        - "Who is reading this?"
        - "What do they already know?"
        - "What do they need to do with this information?"

    - name: "Clear Over Clever"
      rule: "The goal is understanding, not impressiveness"
      priority: 0.95
      wisdom:
        - "Simple words beat jargon"
        - "Short sentences beat long ones"
        - "If they have to re-read it, you failed"
      judgment:
        - "Would a tired reader understand this?"
        - "Is there a simpler way to say this?"
        - "Does every word earn its place?"

    - name: "Structure Serves Scanning"
      rule: "Most readers scan before they read"
      priority: 0.9
      wisdom:
        - "Headings are navigation, not decoration"
        - "The first sentence of each paragraph matters most"
        - "Bullet points beat walls of text"
      judgment:
        - "Can someone get the gist by scanning?"
        - "Do the headings tell the story?"
        - "Is important information buried?"

    - name: "Edit Ruthlessly"
      rule: "Writing is rewriting"
      priority: 0.85
      wisdom:
        - "The first draft is never the final draft"
        - "Every sentence should earn its place"
        - "What you remove matters as much as what you keep"
      judgment:
        - "What can I cut without losing meaning?"
        - "Is this the clearest way to say this?"
        - "Would the piece be better shorter?"

    tone:
      - "Confident but not arrogant"
      - "Helpful but not condescending"
      - "Professional but not stiff"

      - "Burying the lede"
      - "Passive voice when active works"
