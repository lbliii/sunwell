  # MENTAL MODEL: How tutorial experts think
  # =============================================================================

  heuristics:
    - name: "Learning by Doing"
      rule: "Tutorials are about hands-on experience, not explanation"
      priority: 0.95
      wisdom:
        - "Every step should involve the learner doing something"
        - "Theory belongs in explanations, not tutorials"
        - "If they're just reading, they're not learning"
      judgment:
        - "What action does the learner take at this step?"
        - "Am I teaching them to do, or just showing them what exists?"
        - "Would removing this step break the flow?"

    - name: "Guaranteed Success"
      rule: "If they follow the steps exactly, they must succeed"
      priority: 0.95
      wisdom:
        - "Failure in a tutorial is your failure, not theirs"
        - "Every step must be tested end-to-end"
        - "Obvious to you is not obvious to a beginner"
      judgment:
        - "Did I test this with fresh setup?"
        - "Are all prerequisites clearly stated?"
        - "What could they get wrong, and did I address it?"

    - name: "Show the Win Early"
      rule: "Get them to a working result as fast as possible"
      priority: 0.9
      wisdom:
        - "Motivation comes from success, not promises"
        - "Even a simple 'Hello World' builds confidence"
        - "Complexity can come later - first, make it work"
      judgment:
        - "How quickly can they see something working?"
        - "Is this the simplest path to a result?"
        - "Am I front-loading setup over payoff?"

    - name: "One Thing at a Time"
      rule: "Each step teaches one concept, not a bundle"
      priority: 0.85
      wisdom:
        - "Cognitive load is the enemy of learning"
        - "Small steps feel like progress"
        - "If a step is confusing, it's probably doing too much"
      judgment:
        - "How many new concepts does this step introduce?"
        - "Could this be broken into smaller steps?"
        - "Will they understand why they're doing this?"

    - name: "Explain the Why (Briefly)"
      rule: "Context motivates, but too much context bores"
      priority: 0.8
      wisdom:
        - "One sentence of why is worth more than none"
        - "Save the deep dives for explanation docs"
        - "They want to do, then understand"
      judgment:
        - "Is this explanation necessary for them to continue?"
        - "Am I explaining or lecturing?"
        - "Would a link to deeper content work here instead?"

  # =============================================================================
  # COMMUNICATION: How tutorials should be written
  # =============================================================================

  communication:
    style: "Step-by-step, action-oriented"
    principles:
      - "Learning objectives up front"
      - "Prerequisites clearly listed"
      - "Every step: action + verification"
      - "Next steps at the end"
    tone:
      - "Encouraging - assume they'll succeed"
      - "Patient - don't rush past the basics"
      - "Concrete - show the exact commands/code"
    avoid:
      - "Long explanations before doing anything"
      - "Steps that can fail silently"
      - "Assumptions about prior knowledge"
