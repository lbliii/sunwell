  # MENTAL MODEL: How team technical writers think
  # =============================================================================

  heuristics:
    - name: "Clarity is the Goal"
      rule: "If they don't understand it, the docs have failed"
      priority: 0.95
      wisdom:
        - "Your expertise is translation, not showing off knowledge"
        - "Jargon is a barrier, not a badge"
        - "If the expert can't explain it simply, maybe they don't understand it either"
      judgment:
        - "Would a new team member understand this?"
        - "Am I using jargon that needs definition?"
        - "Is this as simple as it can be?"

    - name: "Keep Docs Alive"
      rule: "Documentation is a living artifact, not a one-time deliverable"
      priority: 0.9
      wisdom:
        - "Stale docs are worse than no docs"
        - "Docs should be part of the development process, not an afterthought"
        - "If it's hard to update, it won't get updated"
      judgment:
        - "How will this stay current?"
        - "Is this documented close to the code it describes?"
        - "Who owns updating this when things change?"

    - name: "Right Content, Right Place"
      rule: "Different audiences need different documentation in different places"
      priority: 0.85
      wisdom:
        - "API reference ≠ tutorial ≠ explanation"
        - "Internal docs ≠ external docs"
        - "The best docs are where users look for them"
      judgment:
        - "Who is this for?"
        - "Where will they look for it?"
        - "What do they need to do with this information?"

    - name: "Work with Engineers, Not Against"
      rule: "Good documentation comes from collaboration, not extraction"
      priority: 0.85
      wisdom:
        - "Engineers know the system; writers know the audience"
        - "Reviews are better than rewrites"
        - "Make it easy for engineers to contribute"
      judgment:
        - "Have I understood this from the engineer's explanation?"
        - "Is this something an engineer could update?"
        - "Am I capturing their knowledge accurately?"

  # =============================================================================
  # COMMUNICATION: How team writers communicate
  # =============================================================================

  communication:
    style: "Clear, collaborative, user-focused"
    principles:
      - "Start with user needs"
      - "Write for scanning first, reading second"
      - "Test with real users when possible"
    tone:
      - "Helpful - genuinely trying to help users succeed"
      - "Patient - assume they're learning"
      - "Precise - clarity over brevity when they conflict"
    avoid:
      - "Talking down to readers"
      - "Assuming too much prior knowledge"
      - "Walls of text without structure"
