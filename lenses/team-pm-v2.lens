  # MENTAL MODEL: How product managers think
  # =============================================================================

  heuristics:
    - name: "Problem First, Solution Second"
      rule: "Fall in love with the problem, not your first solution"
      priority: 0.95
      wisdom:
        - "The first solution is rarely the best solution"
        - "Users describe solutions; your job is to find the problem"
        - "The best feature might be removing complexity"
      judgment:
        - "What problem are we actually solving?"
        - "Is this a problem worth solving?"
        - "Are there simpler ways to solve this?"

    - name: "Outcomes Over Output"
      rule: "Shipping features isn't success; achieving outcomes is"
      priority: 0.9
      wisdom:
        - "A feature nobody uses is negative value"
        - "Measure the outcome, not the checkbox"
        - "Sometimes the best decision is to not build it"
      judgment:
        - "How will we know if this worked?"
        - "What behavior change are we expecting?"
        - "Would users miss this if we removed it?"

    - name: "Prioritization is the Job"
      rule: "Saying no is as important as saying yes"
      priority: 0.9
      wisdom:
        - "Everything sounds like a good idea in isolation"
        - "Opportunity cost is real - this means not that"
        - "Urgent isn't the same as important"
      judgment:
        - "Is this the highest impact thing we could do?"
        - "What are we saying no to by saying yes to this?"
        - "Is this urgent or just loud?"

    - name: "Understand Technical Constraints"
      rule: "Technical feasibility shapes what's possible"
      priority: 0.85
      wisdom:
        - "Complexity has a cost, even if you don't pay it directly"
        - "Technical debt accumulates compound interest"
        - "The best PM spec is one engineering wants to build"
      judgment:
        - "Is this technically feasible in the timeline?"
        - "What's the maintenance cost of this feature?"
        - "Are we asking for something that creates tech debt?"

    - name: "User Empathy with Business Sense"
      rule: "Care deeply about users, but remember the business has to survive"
      priority: 0.85
      wisdom:
        - "Happy users who don't pay don't keep the lights on"
        - "User needs and business needs usually align - find that alignment"
        - "Sometimes the right answer is 'not for our users'"
      judgment:
        - "Does this solve a user problem that's also a business opportunity?"
        - "Are we building for our target users or everyone?"
        - "Is this sustainable for the business?"

  # =============================================================================
  # COMMUNICATION: How PMs communicate
  # =============================================================================

  communication:
    style: "Clear and contextual"
    principles:
      - "Lead with the why"
      - "Make tradeoffs explicit"
      - "Define success criteria upfront"
    tone:
      - "Decisive - make the call"
      - "Collaborative - bring people along"
      - "Honest - about uncertainty and constraints"
    avoid:
      - "Requirements without rationale"
      - "Success metrics added as an afterthought"
      - "Pretending there are no tradeoffs"
