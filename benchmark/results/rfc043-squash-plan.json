  "goal": "Implement the following specification:\n\nHere\u2019s a concise implementation goal statement based on the provided verified facts:\n\n**Goal: Develop a Draft Version of Sunwell Studio \u2013 An Inverted IDE for Creative AI Workflows**\n\n**Objective:** To create a functional, draft version of Sunwell Studio, a GUI application leveraging an inverted IDE paradigm to facilitate creative workflows with AI, prioritizing simplicity, adaptive UI, and multi-domain support.\n\n**Key Requirements & Deliverables:**\n\n*   **Core Functionality:** The Studio must provide a single, intuitive input field for initiating AI-driven creative tasks (code, prose, scripts, dialogue).\n*   **One-Click Preview:**  Enable immediate, interactive previews of AI-generated content directly within the Studio.\n*   **Adaptive UI:** Implement a dynamic UI that adjusts based on the selected task and user input, minimizing UI clutter and maximizing creative focus.\n*   **Local-First Operation:** Ensure all data and AI processing occur locally, prioritizing user privacy and responsiveness.\n*   **Multi-Domain Support:**  The Studio must support the generation of content across multiple domains \u2013 code, prose, scripts, and dialogue \u2013 within a single workflow.\n\n**Technology Stack:**\n\n*   **Framework:** (Based on the document, this is initially a draft, but we anticipate)  A GUI framework suitable for rapid prototyping and visual development (e.g., Electron, React Native, or a similar cross-platform solution).\n*   **Language:** Python (likely for AI integration and backend logic, aligning with Ollama\u2019s approach).\n*   **Tools:**  (To be determined during development, but likely includes) Version control (Git), a suitable IDE for Python development, and potentially a local LLM runtime (consistent with the Ollama concept).\n\n**Implementation Phases (Milestones):**\n\n1.  **Core Input & Preview Prototype (2 weeks):** Establish the single input field and basic one-click preview functionality.\n2.  **Adaptive UI Skeleton (3 weeks):** Develop the foundational adaptive UI structure and initial interaction flows.\n3.  **Multi-Domain Support Integration (4 weeks):** Integrate support for code, prose, scripts, and dialogue generation.\n4.  **Local-First Operation & Refinement (2 weeks):**  Finalize local data handling and conduct thorough UI/UX refinement.\n\n**Non-Goals:**  This draft version will *not* include a",
