STRUCTURE: 7/10 – The tutorial is logically organized into objectives, prerequisites, guided steps, outcomes, gotchas, and next steps, but it lacks a clear table of contents and some sections feel abruptly introduced.  
ACCURACY: 9/10 – The code examples are syntactically correct, use `requests` properly, and the JSON parsing matches the actual PokeAPI schema; only minor omissions (e.g., handling non‑JSON responses) are present.  
AUDIENCE: 8/10 – The content is approachable for beginners with basic HTTP knowledge and is not overly simplistic, though it could clarify the scope a bit more for very new developers.  
STYLE: 8/10 – The writing is concise, uses active voice, and balances concrete code with explanatory text; a few extraneous references could be trimmed for cleaner readability.  
COMPLETENESS: 7/10 – Prerequisites, error handling, and next steps are provided, but deeper coverage of pagination, caching, and advanced usage would round out the guide.  

TOTAL: 39/50
