STRUCTURE: 7/10 – The tutorial is logically divided into sections and uses progressive disclosure, but it could benefit from a more detailed outline (e.g., separate error handling, pagination, and caching sections).  

ACCURACY: 8/10 – The code examples are correct and would run as written, though they omit handling JSON decoding errors and could be more robust with retries.  

AUDIENCE: 8/10 – The material is approachable for intermediate Python developers, neither too basic nor too advanced; it assumes familiarity with HTTP and JSON.  

STYLE: 7/10 – The writing is concise and mostly active, but some sections feel rushed and the signal‑to‑noise ratio could be tightened by removing a few redundant comments.  

COMPLETENESS: 7/10 – Prerequisites, common pitfalls, and a final checklist are included, but deeper coverage of pagination, caching, and advanced error handling would make it more thorough.  

TOTAL: 37/50
