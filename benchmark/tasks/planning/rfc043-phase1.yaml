# The goal to plan
goal: |
  Implement Sunwell Studio Phase 1: A Tauri desktop app with Svelte frontend.
  
  Requirements:
  1. Tauri project with Rust backend (src-tauri/)
  2. Svelte frontend (src/)
  3. Launch screen with centered input bar
  4. Dark theme CSS variables
  5. IPC bridge to connect frontend to Sunwell Python agent subprocess
  6. Basic window configuration
  
  Output: Working Tauri+Svelte skeleton that can launch.
