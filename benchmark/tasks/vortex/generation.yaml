    name: "Function implementation"
    category: generation
    task: |
      Implement a function that validates an email address.
      Requirements:
      - Must have @ symbol
      - Must have domain with dot
      - Return True/False
    evaluation:
      - "Has function definition"
      - "Checks for @ symbol"
      - "Checks for domain"
      - "Returns boolean"
    difficulty: easy
    
  - id: gen-002
    name: "Error message writing"
    task: |
      Write a user-friendly error message for:
      "FileNotFoundError: config.yaml not found in /app/config/"
      
      The message should:
      - Explain what went wrong
      - Suggest how to fix it
      - Be non-technical
    evaluation:
      - "Explains missing file"
      - "Provides actionable fix"
      - "Avoids jargon"
    difficulty: medium

  - id: gen-003
    name: "API documentation"
    task: |
      Write documentation for this function:
      ```python
      def retry(fn, max_attempts=3, delay=1.0, backoff=2.0):
          ...
      ```
      Include: description, parameters, return value, example.
    evaluation:
      - "Clear description"
      - "All parameters documented"
      - "Working example"
    difficulty: medium
    
  - id: gen-004
    name: "Test case generation"
    task: |
      Generate test cases for this function:
      ```python
      def divide(a: float, b: float) -> float:
          if b == 0:
              raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
          return a / b
      ```
      Include edge cases.
    evaluation:
      - "Tests normal case"
      - "Tests zero divisor"
      - "Tests negative numbers"
      - "Tests floats"
    difficulty: medium

      Refactor this code to be more readable:
      ```python
      def f(x):
          return [i for i in x if i%2==0 and i>0 and i<100]
      ```
    evaluation:
      - "Better function name"
      - "Clear variable names"
      - "Readable conditions"
    difficulty: easy

      but not hash tables. Use an analogy.
    evaluation:
      - "Uses accessible analogy"
      - "Explains key concepts (hashing, buckets, collisions)"
      - "Connects to prior knowledge (arrays)"
    difficulty: hard
    notes: "Tests multiple perspectives (teacher, expert, simplifier)"
