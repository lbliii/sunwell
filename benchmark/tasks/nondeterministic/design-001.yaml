    A startup needs to choose between two database architectures:
    
    Option A: PostgreSQL with read replicas
    - Proven, reliable, strong consistency
    - Team knows it well
    - May need sharding later at scale
    
    Option B: CockroachDB 
    - Built-in horizontal scaling
    - Learning curve for team
    - Newer, less battle-tested
    
    The startup has 10 engineers, expects 10x growth in 2 years,
    and prioritizes developer velocity.
    
    Make a recommendation and justify it. There is no "correct" answer -
    reasonable engineers disagree on this.
