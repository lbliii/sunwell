  prompt: |
    Write an explanation document about a multi-layer caching architecture for a web application.
    
    The architecture has:
    - L1: In-memory cache (per-process)
    - L2: Redis cache (shared across instances)
    - L3: Database with query caching
    
    Explain:
    - Why this architecture was chosen
    - How cache invalidation works across layers
    - Trade-offs of this approach
    - When to use each layer
