    Write a tutorial introducing async/await in Python.
    
    Target audience: Python developer unfamiliar with async programming.
    
    Cover these concepts in order:
    1. What is async programming and why use it
    2. Basic async/await syntax
    3. Running async functions with asyncio
    4. Concurrent execution with gather()
    5. Common pitfalls (blocking calls, forgetting await)
    
    Use practical examples like fetching multiple URLs concurrently.
