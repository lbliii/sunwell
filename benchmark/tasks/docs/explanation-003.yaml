  category: "documentation"
  subcategory: "explanation"
  
  prompt: |
    Write an explanation of Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
    
    Cover:
    1. What the GIL is and why CPython has it
    2. Impact on multithreading performance
    3. CPU-bound vs I/O-bound workloads
    4. Workarounds (multiprocessing, asyncio, C extensions)
    5. Free-threading in Python 3.13+ (PEP 703)
    
    Explain when the GIL matters and when it doesn't.
