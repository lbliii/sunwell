  prompt: |
    Write an explanation comparing async/await vs threading in Python.
    
    Cover:
    1. When to use async (I/O bound, many concurrent connections)
    2. When to use threading (legacy blocking code, simple parallelism)
    3. When to use multiprocessing (CPU bound)
    4. How asyncio event loop works
    5. GIL implications for each
    6. Memory and context-switching overhead comparison
    
    Include decision flowchart or criteria.
