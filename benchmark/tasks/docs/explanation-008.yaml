  prompt: |
    Write an explanation of Python's memory model for intermediate developers.
    
    Cover:
    1. Objects, references, and identity (id(), is, ==)
    2. Mutable vs immutable objects
    3. Reference counting and garbage collection
    4. Weak references and when to use them
    5. Memory profiling with tracemalloc
    6. Common memory pitfalls (circular references, large collections)
    
    Use practical examples throughout.
