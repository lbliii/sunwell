  prompt: |
    Write an explanation of Dependency Injection in Python.
    
    Cover:
    1. What is dependency injection and why it matters
    2. The problem it solves (tight coupling, testing difficulty)
    3. Manual DI vs DI frameworks
    4. Common patterns (constructor injection, parameter injection)
    5. When to use DI vs when it's overkill
    
    Use concrete Python examples showing before/after code.
