# Help

Context-aware suggestions based on current state.

**Shortcuts**: `::?` (context-aware), `::help` (full reference)

---

## Context-Aware Help (::?)

Analyze current state and suggest actions:

```yaml
if editing_python_in_core:
  suggest:
    - "::types" - Check type compliance
    - "::arch" - Verify architecture patterns
    - "::modify-core" - Guide for core changes

if editing_tests:
  suggest:
    - "::validate" - Verify test coverage
    - "::implement" - Continue implementation

if viewing_plan_or_rfc:
  suggest:
    - "::implement" - Start implementation
    - "::validate" - Verify claims

if uncommitted_changes:
  suggest:
    - "::validate" - Pre-commit check
    - "::workflow-ship" - Full pre-merge flow

if no_clear_context:
  suggest:
    - "::research [topic]" - Understand codebase
    - "::help" - Full command reference
```

## Natural Language

Just describe what you want:
- "How does X work?" → research
- "Should we add Y?" → RFC
- "Fix bug in Z" → implement
- "Check my changes" → validate
