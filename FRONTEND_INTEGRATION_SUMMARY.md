## 🔄 Remaining Work (Lower Priority)

### Coordinator Worker Details
**Status:** Not started
**Complexity:** Low
**Description:** Add GET endpoint for `/coordinator/workers/{worker_id}` to show worker details.

**Files Needed:**
- `src/sunwell/interface/chirp/pages/coordinator/workers/{worker_id}/page.py`
- `src/sunwell/interface/chirp/pages/coordinator/workers/{worker_id}/page.html`

### SSE Live Updates

**Complexity:** Medium
**Description:** Add `/system/stream` SSE endpoint for real-time notifications.

**Files Needed:**
- `src/sunwell/interface/chirp/pages/system/stream.py`
- Hook up BackgroundManager events to SSE stream

**Benefits:**
- Real-time UI updates without polling
- Agent completion notifications
- Error alerts

### End-to-End Testing
**Status:** Not started
**Complexity:** Medium
**Description:** Comprehensive testing of all user flows.

**Areas to Test:**
- Project lifecycle (create, set default, delete)
- Goal creation and viewing
- Document creation
- Memory filtering and search
- Settings persistence
- HTMX interactions
- Form validation
- Error handling

## 📊 Statistics

- **Total Endpoints Added:** 15+

| Library | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ | ➖ | ➖ | **Complete** |
| DAG | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ | ➖ | ➖ | **Complete** |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the application** - Start the Chirp server and test all flows
2. **Add coordinator worker details** - Quick win, low complexity
3. **Implement SSE streaming** - For real-time updates
4. **Add comprehensive tests** - Ensure stability

## 📝 Notes

- All "Coming Soon" placeholders are clearly marked
- Phase 2 features (Canvas visualizations) have placeholders
- Security: API keys are never sent to frontend
- All HTMX interactions use proper targets and swaps
- Modal forms have consistent styling and behavior
- Error handling is in place for all endpoints
- Form validation is implemented where needed

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements Made

- Consistent modal styling across all forms
- Proper loading states with HTMX indicators
- Status messages for user feedback
- Breadcrumb navigation for detail pages
- Filter tabs with active states
- Search with debounced input
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Badge components for status/priority
- Progress bars for goal tracking
