## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Component Library
- Created 14 reusable components in `components/`
- Adopted components across all pages
- Replaced inline HTML with component calls

### Project Organization
- Moved `static/` to top-level (from nested in pages)
- Created `lib/` for shared utilities
- Created `schemas/` for form definitions
- Split `services/` from 694-line monolith into 8 modules

### Directory Structure

## 🎨 Component Library

All components now use proper kida syntax:

1. **alert.html** - Alert messages with variants
2. **badge.html** - Simple badges

4. **card.html** - Card containers
5. **empty.html** - Empty state placeholders
6. **forms.html** - Form fields with validation
7. **modal.html** - Modal dialogs
8. **pagination.html** - Page navigation
9. **progress.html** - Progress bars
10. **spinner.html** - Loading states
11. **status.html** - Status indicators
